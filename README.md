# Etch-a-Sketch Project

## Overview
This project is a modern take on the classic Etch-a-Sketch toy, reimagined as a web-based application. It offers an interactive drawing experience where users can create pixelated artwork by simply hovering over a grid with their mouse. I built this project to practice and showcase my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Drawing Grid**: Provides a 16x16 grid of squares that change color when hovered over, allowing users to create unique pixelated drawings.
- **Random RGB Coloring**: Adds a creative touch by automatically assigning a random color to each square upon interaction.
- **Progressive Darkening Effect**: Enhances the drawing experience by gradually darkening the color of a square with each interaction.
- **Customizable Grid Size**: Empowers users to adjust the level of detail in their drawings by creating a new grid with a custom number of squares per side.

## Technical Highlights

- **Dynamic DOM Manipulation**: Used JavaScript to dynamically generate the drawing grid and apply event listeners to each square for real-time interaction.
- **CSS Flexbox and Grid Layout**: Leveraged CSS Flexbox and Grid Layout to create a responsive and flexible grid that adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Algorithm Optimization**: Implemented efficient algorithms for random color generation and progressive color darkening to ensure smooth user experience.

## How to Use

1. Open the project in a web browser.
2. Hover over the squares with your mouse to start drawing on the grid.
3. Click the "New Grid" button to create a new grid with your desired number of squares per side.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
